# VALCord

The public code for **VALCord**, a VALORANT statistics bot for Discord.

## About

**VALCord** was my first project—and one of the most ambitious ones I've worked on. It started as a simple Discord bot for tracking Valorant stats, but quickly grew into a full-featured tool with match analysis, leaderboards, and performance tracking.

## History

- **Started:** August 21, 2022
- **Ended:** December 2024
- **Peak Usage:**
  - ~1,000 Discord servers
  - ~20,000 unique users in database
  - Top server had over 100,000 members

After launching version 1, I set out to rebuild VALCord from the ground up, focusing on efficiency and scalability with plans to eventually make it profitable. However, by 2024, I had a realization—while VALCord was a valuable learning experience, maintaining it required more time and effort than it could sustain financially.

Ultimately, I made the tough decision to discontinue VALCord, but the process taught me valuable lessons about scaling projects, building for users, and balancing passion with practicality.

## Why This Code is Public

I know this is not the best code, but it was my first project and I wanted to make it public as I no longer maintain it. This repository serves as a snapshot of my early work and learning journey.

## Features

- VALORANT statistics tracking
- Match analysis
- Leaderboards
